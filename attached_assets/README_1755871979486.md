## 🎨 Customization

### Theme Colors
Edit the CSS variables in `src/index.css` to customize colors:

```css
:root {
  --primary: hsl(0, 79%, 69%);        /* Coral red */
  --secondary: hsl(174, 56%, 57%);    /* Teal */
  --accent: hsl(203, 69%, 57%);       /* Blue */
  --success: hsl(142, 43%, 68%);      /* Green */
}
```

### Adding New Exercises
The app comes pre-seeded with popular exercises. Data is stored in localStorage and managed by the `MockStorage` class in `src/data/mockStorage.ts`.

## 📊 Data Storage

This version uses **localStorage** for data persistence. All workouts, exercises, and goals are stored locally in your browser. Data will persist across sessions but is specific to each browser/device.

## 🔧 Available Scripts

- `npm start` - Start development server
- `npm run build` - Build for production  
- `npm test` - Run tests
- `npm run eject` - Eject from Create React App (⚠️ irreversible)
